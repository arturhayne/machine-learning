## Supervised Classification

Learning about supervised classification using gaussian naive bayes.
The ideias is make input predictions based in a pre-trained dataset.

### 
The objective of this exercise is to recreate the decision boundary found in the lesson [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpnDwiqTCJA&t=1s), and make a plot that visually shows the decision boundary.
