## Regression
In machine learning, regression is a type of supervised learning task that involves predicting a continuous output variable (also called a dependent variable) based on one or more input features (independent variables). The primary purpose of regression is to establish a relationship between the input variables and the output variable. This relationship is represented by a mathematical function that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Formula

y = ax + b

Linear formula where a = slope and b = intercept

## Comparing Classification and Regression

 Property|Supervised Classification| Regression
--- | --- | --- |
output type | discrete | continuous
what find | decision boundary | "best fit line"
evaluation | accuracy | "sum of squared errors"
